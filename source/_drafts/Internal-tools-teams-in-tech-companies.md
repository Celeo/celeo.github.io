My thoughts on tech companies having internal tools teams and what they do, how they function, and their paths to success.

The thoughts and opinions here are my own and do not reflect those of my employers.

First, I want to clarify the environment I'm talking about: _internal_ (not customer-facing) engineering teams working on building software that is used by other teams. Several of the companies I've worked at have had teams like this, to various levels of success. I'm writing this to put many thoughts and experiences into words. I hope that what I have to say on the topic may resonate with other people, and may even help people looking to enter one of these such environments clarify what they may be getting themselves into.
