Some notes about otherworldly entities:

- Ghosts are, as expected, remnants of dead humans. Native to the material world and tied to Death magic.
- Spirits are beings of things, from houses and trees to emotions and events (not people themselves). Native to the Shadow and tied to Spirit magic. Have to pass through the Gauntlet to get the material world.
- Goetia are beings of thought. Native to the Astral Realms and tied to Mind magic.
- Ephemeral entities are those 3 entities: ghosts, spirits, and goetia. Naturally, they cannot interact with the material world nor are aware of beings of the other types. They can enter the material world be being summoned or they fight their way in. Twilight is a state of being for them: invisible and intangible - not manifested. Manifesting means they take physical shape in the material world; they can do this through magic or some other conditions.
- Supernal entities are different - Fae, Demons, Shades, Beasts, Angels. These beings are from their respective Supernal World. They don't go into the material world nor Twilight unless summoned (or some weird stuff happens).
- When viewing the world from the Twilight, it's like you're in a dream or through a sort of shimmering veil. Like if you maxed out bloom on your screen. Entities and things in Twilight that are of the same ephemera can "physically" interact, like ghosts with other ghosts.
- "Rank" determines ephemeral and Supernal entity strength. Over 5 is nuts.
- Ephemeral entities subsist on Essence. They must spent 1 per day to remain active in the material world, and once per hour when existing outside a suitable condition.
- Supernal entities subsist on Mana. They do not need to spend it to remain in the material world.
- Ghosts, goetia, and Supernal entities naturally refill their pools when in their home realms. Spirits do not. Ephemeral entities regain 1 point per day in the material world be being close to an appropriate condition.
