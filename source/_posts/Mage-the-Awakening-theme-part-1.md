There are many ways to use different Arcana to solve a problem. Need to pass a math test? Could **Fate** it to be successful; use **Life** to give yourself more raw intelligence; use **Matter** to make your test a clone of the smart kid's test; boost your knowledge of math with **Mind**; coax the **Spirit** of the test to pass itself; speak to the last teacher's ghost with **Death**; or create more **Time** to study. Could even use any of those to make other people test worse and shoot for the curved grading.

What about being in a car going down the road, and another car runs the red and is about to slam into you? You could use **Forces** to reduce the other car's velocity, or create more space between them with **Space** or **Time**. **Matter** or **Death** could force the other car off its path. **Life**, **Mind**, **Fate**, **Spirit**, **Forces**, or **Time** could give you the reflexes to react. If you're going to get hit, **Life**, **Death**, or **Time** could fix the damage to your body.

Need to find someone? Could simply **Fate** your paths to cross; find where they were last with **Time**; find who last saw them with **Mind**; or trace their steps with **Matter**, **Death**, **Space**, or **Spirit**.
