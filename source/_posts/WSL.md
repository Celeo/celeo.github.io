For years, I've been using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run Linux virtual machines (currently using Arch \[btw]), but I've gotten started with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), and it's fantastic. Microsoft is certainly trying to make the developer community like them, and here's another win for everyone.

"Windows Subsystem for Linux" is a way to seamlessly run a tiny Linux VM on your Windows 10+ machine. To run Linux on a machine that runs Windows, there are a few options, here sorted in terms of more involved to least:

- Have two computers
- Dual-boot
- Dedicated VM
- WSL

From this, WSL is the _least_ involved to set up (or buy), and also the least involved to use. It's ... just _there_.

I don't hate running VMs through VirtualBox - it's been incredibly useful for me over the years, for learning Linux, learning Unix tooling, connecting to and setting up VPSes (often through DigitalOcean), setting up VMs for my employers, etc. I owe a lot of my learning to VirtualBox. Over the years, I've gotten pretty handy with it, and also with the various Linux distributions that I've used (Ubuntu, \*ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Fedora, Arch, and more).

To install WSL, you can follow the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and/or take a look at these two videos: [1](https://youtu.be/-atblwgc63E), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eqZujVfYU).

10/10, would recommend.
