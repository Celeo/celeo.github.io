I've been going back and forth on whether or not to post this at all for some time. I don't actually have any specific point to reach, no fact to claim. Between books, movies, TV, and video games, I've noticed a reoccurring trend in storytelling and world building: the use of _decline_.

<!-- more -->

_Decline_ might be for the world, magic, civilization, technology, or something else. Or perhaps multiple of these. In _The Lord of the Rings_ and _Wheel of Time_, we see the previous peoples having lived and died, and their works being unmatched. Magic, as Tolkein writes it, is declining, and at the end of the story, with the destruction of the One Ring, magic is all but gone from the world. In _Ori and the Blind Forest_ _Hollow Knight_. and _Kena_, we see the world have been previously wonderful, but now corrupted and dead. Similarly in _Dishonored_, though the player experiences the game before "complete decline". In _Dwarf Fortress_, civilizations have risen and died many times before the player even starts interacting with their dwarves. In _Dead Cells_, _Rain World_, _Elden Ring_, and the _Fallout_ series, the world is all but destroyed.

In some of these stories, the _decline_ of the world is the primary driving force, whether that's to overcome previous faults or return to paradise. In some, the _decline_ is unsurmountable, and live moves on the best it can. In others, the _decline_ fuels new wonders. Sometimes, characters lament what was before; in others, the past is to be feared and shunned. Sometimes, the loss of what was sets the mood - sad, angry, fearful, or happy.

Like I wrote to open this, I don't really have a point to make here. It's something that I've seen enough to think about sometimes.
