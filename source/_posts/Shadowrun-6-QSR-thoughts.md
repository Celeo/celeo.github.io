Thoughts on the QSR rules that CGL have released.

<!-- more -->

## Notes

* Hosts are nearly the same; OS doesn't increase while in hosts now
* ASDF are the same
* Attack rating = `Attack + Sleaze`
* Defense Rating = `Data Processing + Firewall`
* AR and VR are the same
* PANs are the same, with a clarification that in order to access an icon on a PAN, the PAN itself must be first accessed
* Commlinks are the same
* Decks are different - now they're "sleak modern versions of medieval gauntlets"
* Icons ar the same
* Personas are the same
* The "bricked" status is the same
* Legal tests all use `Electronics + Logic`
* Illegal tests all uses `Cracking + Logic`
* Defending against Matrix actions is (usually) `Firewall + Willpower`
* OS is still present
    * Instead of increasing by 2d6 every 15 minutes, a hacker's OS increases by 1 every round, which is dramatically faster than in SR5
    * This increase by time is only "when you have illegal User access". Does that mean it doesn't increase if the hacker has illegal Root access? How does a hacker "dispose of" access without rebooting (or jacking out, as it's now known)?
* Programs seem the same, but it's hard to tell as there are only 3 so far
* There doesn't seem to be a distinction between "loud" hacking and "stealthy" hacking yet - all hacking is "loud"
* Actions
    * Control Device is simpler than the SR5 version
        * Why is this illegal? In SR5 it was legal.
    * Crack File is the same
    * Data Spike is the same
    * Edit File is nearly the same - there aren't any rules for databombs (yet?)
    * Enter/Exit Host seems to be the same
    * Format Device is the same
    * Hack is basically SR5 "Hack on the Fly" minus the free Perception
    * Jack Out is a combination of SR5 "Jack Out" and "Reboot"
    * Matrix Perception is SR5 "Matrix Perception" + "Matrix Search", but simpler
    * Snoop is the same
    * Spoof Command is pretty different - in SR5, a MARK was required on the *persona* that the hacke wanted to send the command from; in SR6, the hacker only requires access on the device itself
    * Trace Icon is nearly the same; now it can be used to go from physical location to icon location

## My thoughts

Obviously, since these are QSR, there is a lot missing. Since this is Shadowrun by CGL, the editing is awful and the rules are generally incomplete and uninspired.

Questions I still have:

* What's required to access a host?
* What's required to access files in a host?
* No more grids?
* How does a hacker hide?
* Why does the OS increase so fast?
* How does a hacker revoke their access to something?
* What's the difference between user access and root access, mechanically?
* Is there a way to invite access to another persona?
* Which actions require hacking the icon beforehand, and which don't?
* Technomancers?

A lot of the matrix rules seem more hand-wavey, which does make some sense, as we only have access to some very abridged (I hope) Matrix rules.
