[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is here!

<!-- more -->

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source! Developers, writers, artists, translators, testers, and everyone is encouraged to participate in open source during this month. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is again partnering with [dev.to](https://dev.to) (and apparently Intel this year) to give prices to participants - shirts!

Signing up is easy: all you need is a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and then head over to the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) page and click "Start Hacking".
